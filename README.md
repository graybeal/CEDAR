# CEDAR
<a href="http://metadatacenter.org">Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval (CEDAR)</a>

The goal of CEDAR is to create a unified framework that researchers in all scientific disciplines can use to create consistent, 
easily searchable metadata. Ease of use is paramount. Because the ability to share data is so important, 
we want the process of metadata creation to be as painless as possible. Six key elements contribute to what we 
believe will be a successful system.

## CEDAR Workbench: The Web application

To try out CEDAR, you can visit http://cedar.metadatacenter.net. Once you've given yourself an account and logged in, you'll see the Resource Manager (desktop), where you can search for and create your own templates and metadata. CEDAR's built to be easy to use, so give it a spin, and let us know what you learn.
